# 🐙 Octopus Deploy Official MCP Server

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) allows the AI assistants you use in your day to day work, like Claude Code, or ChatGPT, to connect to the systems and services you own in a standardized fashion, allowing them to pull information from those systems and services to answer questions and perform tasks.

The Octopus MCP Server provides your AI assistant with powerful tools that allow it to inspect, query, and diagnose problems within your Octopus instance, transforming it into your ultimate devops wingmate.
