# üêô Octopus Deploy Official MCP Server

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) allows the AI assistants you use in your day to day work, like Claude Code, or ChatGPT, to connect to the systems and services you own in a standardized fashion, allowing them to pull information from those systems and services to answer questions and perform tasks.

The Octopus MCP Server provides your AI assistant with powerful tools that allow it to inspect, query, and diagnose problems within your Octopus instance, transforming it into your ultimate devops wingmate. 

This project should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.

### Octopus Server Compatibility

The MCP Server is developed and tested against versions `2025.3.x` of Octopus Server. Most of the APIs used are stable and exist in prior versions of Octopus and should therefore be generally compatible but we will not be testing or deliberately maintaining compatibility with older versions of Octopus.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

While the Octopus MCP Server at this stage is a read-only tool it **can read full deployment logs, which could include secrets stored in your Octopus Server, such as production keys.** Excercise caution when connecting Octopus MCP to tools and models you do not fully trust.

Running agents in a fully automated fashion could make you vulnerable to exposure via prompt-injection attacks that exfiltrate tokens.

Excercise caution and mitigate the risks by using least-privileged accounts when connecting to Octopus Server.

## üöÄ Installation

```
TBD
```

### Configuration Options

The Octopus MCP Server supports several command-line options to customize which tools are available:

#### Toolsets
Use the `--toolsets` parameter to enable specific groups of tools:

```bash
# Enable all toolsets (default)
npm start

# Enable only specific toolsets
npm start -- --toolsets projects,deployments

# Enable all toolsets explicitly
npm start -- --toolsets all
```

Available toolsets:
- **core** - Basic operations (always enabled) (`list_spaces`,`list_environments`)
- **projects** - Project operations (`list_projects`)
- **deployments** - Deployment operations (`list_deployments`, `get_latest_deployment`)
- **releases** - Release management (`get_release_by_id`, `list_releases`, `list_releases_for_project`)
- **tasks** - Task operations (`get_task_by_id`, `get_task_details`, `get_task_raw`)
- **tenants** - Multi-tenancy operations (`list_tenants`, `get_tenant_by_id`, `get_tenant_variables`, `get_missing_tenant_variables`)
- **kubernetes** - Kubernetes operations (`get_kubernetes_live_status`)
- **machines** - Deployment target operations (`list_deployment_targets`, `get_deployment_target`)

#### Read-Only Mode
The server runs in read-only mode by default for security. All current tools are read-only operations.

```bash
# Run in read-only mode (default)
npm start -- --read-only

# Disable read-only mode (currently no effect as all tools are read-only)
npm start -- --read-only=false
```

#### Complete Examples

```bash
# Development setup with only core and project tools
npm start -- --toolsets core,projects --server-url https://your-octopus.com --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Full production setup with all tools
npm start -- --toolsets all --read-only --server-url https://your-octopus.com --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Contributing

We are keen to hear how you plan to use Octopus MCP server and what features you would like to see us build. You can reach out to our team directly via `TBD`

Alternatively, for issues and feedback please use [Octopus Deploy Issues](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues) repository.

## FAQ

### Do you have plans to release a remote MCP server?

We are working on integrating an MCP server directly into Octopus Server. This will open up the door for us to build more complex tools, as well as:
* Give Octopus Administrators more granular control over MCP clients
* Natively support remote OAuth rather than authorization via API keys
* Integrate security scanning tools into the MCP output
